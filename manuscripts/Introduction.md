# Introduction 介绍

This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2018 Language. It is the ninth edition of the ECMAScript Language
Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most
widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers
but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.

该Ecma标准定义了ECMAScript 2018，这是ECMAScript语言的第九个版本[^1]。自1997年发布第一版以来，ECMAScript已发展为世界上使用最广泛的通用编程语言之一，它作为Web浏览器的预设语言而广为人知，但也被广泛用于服务器和嵌入式应用。

ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and
JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's
Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft
starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.

ECMAScript基于几种原创技术，最为著名的是JavaScript(Netscape[^2])和JScript (Microsoft)。这种语言是由Brendan Eich在Netscape发明，于该公司的Navigator 2.0浏览器之上首次出现。并在Netscape的所有后续浏览器和Microsoft的Internet Explorer 3.0以及之后的所有后续浏览器中一直出现。

The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma
Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.

ECMAScript语言规范的开发始于1996年11月。1997年6月Ecma大会通过本标准的第一版。

That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as
international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second
edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition
are editorial in nature.
