# Introduction 介绍

This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2018 Language. It is the ninth edition of the ECMAScript Language
Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most
widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers
but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.

该Ecma标准定义了ECMAScript 2018，这是ECMAScript语言的第九个版本[^1]。自1997年发布第一版以来，ECMAScript已发展为世界上使用最广泛的通用编程语言之一，它作为Web浏览器的内置语言而广为人知，但也被广泛用于服务器和嵌入式应用。

ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and
JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's
Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft
starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.

ECMAScript基于几种原创技术，最为著名的是JavaScript(Netscape[^2])和JScript (Microsoft)。这种语言是由Brendan Eich在Netscape发明，于该公司的Navigator 2.0浏览器之上首次出现。并在Netscape的所有后续浏览器和Microsoft的Internet Explorer 3.0及其之后的所有浏览器中一直出现。

The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma
Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.

ECMAScript语言规范的开发始于1996年11月。1997年6月Ecma大会通过本标准的第一版。

That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as
international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second
edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition
are editorial in nature.

上述Ecma标准以快速通道程序[^3]提交给ISO / IEC JTC 1，并在1998年4月通过为ISO/IEC 16262国际标准。Ecma大会在1998年6月通过了ECMA-262的第二版以保证其与
ISO/IEC 16262完全一致。第一版和第二版间的变动是编辑性的。

The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control
statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor
changes in anticipation of future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the
Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.

标准第三版引入了强大的正则表达式，更好的字符串处理，新的控制语句，try/catch异常处理，更严格的错误定义，格式化的数字输出以及一些为了未来语言的成长预留的变动。1999年十二月的Ecma大会通过了标准第三版，并在2002年六月作为ISO/IEC 16262:2002 发布。

After publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide
Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant
work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published
as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition.

自第三版发布以来，ECMAScript结合万维网获得了广泛应用，它实际上成为了所有web浏览器都支持的编程语言。为了编制ECMAScript第四版进行了很多有意义的工作，尽管这些工作没能完成且没有发布第四版，但是其中一些纳入了第六版的开发。

The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5 th edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language
specification that have become common among browser implementations and added support for new features that
had emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation
and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for
the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. The
fifth edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 2009.
